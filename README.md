# DM_DimensionalityReduction_Assignment

Included the Dimensionality reduction techniques in colab for the first two parts and in data bricks for the last part. Attached the respective files.

a) Performed dimensionality reduction techniques on digits dataset including PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, LLE, UMAP and t-sne.

b) Perfomed dimensionality reduction on data using UMAP and performed k-means clustering and Random forest classification.

c)Demonstrated dimenionality reduction using databricks. The downloaded code is uploaded in this repo.
